### Overview

In this game, you can choose a character to be your fighter. You will then have to defeat
all of the other remaining characters, one at a time. 
When you attack, your opponent will lose health power. Your opponent will then counter the 
attack and your health power will decrease. When the defender's power is reduced to zero or
below, that character is removed from the game and you can now choose a new opponent.
If your power is reduced to zero of below, you lose the game.
Each time you attack, your attack power is incremented while the defenders counter attack power
remains constant.



### Before You Begin

Choose your player carefully. You want to first fight against a defender with a low counter
attack power.
